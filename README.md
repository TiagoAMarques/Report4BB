# Report4BB
This git repos sole use was to share some analysis questions with Ben Bolker. 

Following some of the threads in BB advice, it also now contains a folder related to the implementation of a Gamma GLMMM in Nimble, which is giving me unexpected results when compared to the glmer (lme4) results. I will ask a question on the nimble group about it.

It's probably temporary and will probably be deleted afterwards.

The original question that got BB attention is here:

https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/616697/how-to-estimate-precision-on-a-prediction-for-a-glmm-for-an-unobserved-level-of/

And a question asked on the nimble users group that relates to stuff inside the LookingAtNiomble folder is here:

Ben Bolker, Ben Augustine, Perry de Valpine, Wei Zhang and Len Thomas provided feedback which might be reflected in this material. All pending errors are solely mine.
