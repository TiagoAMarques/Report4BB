# Report4BB
This git repos sole use was to share some analysis questions with Ben Bolker. 

Following some of the threads in BB advice, it also now contains a folder related to the implementation of a Gamma GLMMM in Nimble, which is giving me unexpected results when compared to the glmer (lme4) results. I will ask a question on the nimble group about it.

It's probably temporary and will probably be deleted afterwards.
